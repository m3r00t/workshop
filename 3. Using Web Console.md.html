#**Lab 3: Web Console Basics**

In this lab exercise, we will review the OpenShift Web Console.

Type in the master public URL provided by your instructor in a browser. Use <master public URL>:8443. You will be directed to an OpenShift login page. 

**Note**: Your browser may complain about the server's security certificates not trusted by your computer. You can agree to proceed to the master URL.

Key in the username and password provided by the instructor. You will see the list of projects now. Note the project you created in the last lab exercise is shown here.

Also note the `New Project...` button which allows you to create a new project from Web Console and the `Delete` button that deletes a project and all its resources.

Now click on the CLI Project to view the details. OpenShift takes you by default to the `Overview` page and shows you a graphic representation of the application that is deployed here.
You can see that a single pod is running and is frontended by a service. Note the route that you configured for this service is also shown.
You will also see the `Add to Project` button on the right top. This can be used to create new application from Web Console inside this project.

You can go back to the projects list page by clicking on 
`OPENSHIFT ENTERPRISE` on the top left of the screen.

* On the Builds screen, you will see a list of previous builds. Select a build and you will see the details from build configuration. Note there are webhook URLs.
We will use them in a later lab exercise. You can start a build from the Web Console by pressing the `Build` button. It also gives you a command to start the build from CLI.

* On the Deployments screen, you will see a list of previous deployments. Select a deployment and you will see the details from deployment configuration.
You can start a deploy from the Web Console by pressing the `Deploy` button. It also gives you a command to start the deploy from CLI.

* On the Events screen, you can see all of the generated events for this particular project. You can also see these on the CLI using `oc get events`

* On the Image Streams screen, you can see a list of Docker Image Streams and their tags and update times. By selecting an image stream you will see the details for that docker image.

* On the Pods tab, you will find a list of pods. You will also see a build pod in the list view that had succeeded.
The running pod is the one running your application image - select it to see the details for that pod.
On the pod details page it tells you the node on which the pod is running.
You can also see and tail the Logs for that pod from the web console

You can also get a terminal shell for that running container straight from the web console. A similar command using CLI is `oc rsh <pod name>` if the pod has bash, or `nsenter -m -u -n -i -p -t <pid>`

* On the Route tab, you will find the list of routes created for your application. Select a route to see the details.

* On the Services tab, you will find the list of services created for your application. Select a service to see the details.


Click on the `Settings` button on the left to see that it would display the Quotas and Resource Limits, if they exist. We will deal with them in a different lab exercise.

Spend a few minutes and familiarize using Web Console.
